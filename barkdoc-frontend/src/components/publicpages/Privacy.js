         We at BarkDoc know you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy. <b>By using or accessing the Services in any manner, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, and you hereby consent that we will collect, use, and share your information in the following ways.</b>
         </p>
         <p>
         Remember that your use of BarkDoc's Services is at all times subject to BarkDoc's Terms which incorporates this Privacy Policy. Any terms we use in this Policy without defining them have the definitions given to them in the <a target="_blank" href="https://wagwalking.com/terms">Terms</a>.

         What does this Privacy Policy cover?
         <p>
          This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that we gather when you are accessing or using our Services, but not to the practices of companies we don't own or control, or people that we don't manage. We gather various types of Personal Information from our users, as explained in more detail below, and we use this Personal Information internally in connection with our Services, including to personalize, provide, and improve our services, to allow you to set up a user account and profile, to contact you and allow other users to contact you, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, and to analyze how you use the Services. In certain cases, we may also share some Personal Information with third parties, but only as described below.
          </p>
         </p>
         <p>
         What Information does BarkDoc Collect?
         </p>
         <p>
          <i>Information You Provide to Us:</i>
         </p>
         <p>
          We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us. For example, through the registration process and/or through your account settings, we may collect Personal Information such as your name, email address, phone number, and third-party account credentials (for example, your log-in credentials for Facebook or other third party sites). If you provide your third-party account credentials to us or otherwise sign in to the Services through a third party site or service], you understand some content and/or information in those accounts ("Third Party Account Information") may be transmitted into your account with us if you authorize such transmissions, and that Third Party Account Information transmitted to our Services is covered by this Privacy Policy. Certain information may be required to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features.
         </p>
         <p>
         We may communicate with you if you've provided us the means to do so. For example, if you've given us your email address, we may send you promotional email offers on behalf of other businesses, or email you about your use of the Services. Also, we may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. This confirmation helps us make our communications with you more interesting and improve our services. If you do not want to receive communications from us, please indicate your preference by clicking the unsubscribe links in our emails.
         </p>
         <p>
            <i>Information Collected Automatically</i>
         </p>
         <p>
          Whenever you interact with our Services, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser or device, which may include your IP address, geolocation data, device identification, "cookie" information, the type of browser and/or device you're using to access our Services, and the page or feature you requested. "Cookies" are identifiers we transfer to your browser or device that allow us to recognize your browser or device and tell us how and when pages and features in our Services are visited and by how many people. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your device's acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features.
         </p>
         <p>
          We may use this data to customize content for you that we think you might like, based on your usage patterns. We may also use it to improve the Services â€“ for example, this data can tell us how often users use a particular feature of the Services, and we can use that knowledge to make the Services interesting to as many users as possible.
         </p>
         <p>
         <i>Google Analytics</i>
         </p>
         <p>
          We use Google Analytics to help analyze how our users' use the Service. Google Analytics uses cookies to collect information such as how often our users visit the Service, what pages they visit, and what other sites they used prior to coming to the Service. We may use the information we get from Google Analytics to improve our Service or to send you promotional messages about our Services. Google Analytics collects the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit the Service, but not your name or other personally identifying information. We do not combine the information generated through the use of Google Analytics with any personally identifying information. Although Google Analytics plants a persistent Cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit the Service, the Cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google's ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Service is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy. You may find additional information about Google Analytics at <a target="_blank" href="www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/">www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/</a>. Finally, you can opt out of Google Analytics by using the following add-on: <a target="_blank" href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/</a>.
         </p>
         <p>
          <i>Information Collected From Other Websites and Do Not Track Policy</i>
         </p>
         <p>
         Through cookies we place on your browser or device, we may collect information about your online activity after you leave our Services. Just like any other usage information we collect, this information allows us to improve the Services and customize your online experience, and otherwise as described in this Privacy Policy. Your browser may offer you a "Do Not Track" option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites. Our Services do not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which means that we collect information about your online activity both while you are using the Services and after you leave our Services
         </p>
         <p>
         Will BarkDoc Share Any of the Personal Information it Receives?
         <p>We do not rent or sell your Personal Information in personally identifiable form to anyone. We may share your Personal Information with third parties as described in this section:</p>
         </p>
         <p>
         <b>Information that's been de-identified.</b> We may de-identify your Personal Information so that you are not identified as an individual, and provide that information to our partners. We may also provide aggregate usage information to our partners (or allow partners to collect that information from you), who may use such information to understand how often and in what ways people use our Services, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal online experience. However, we never disclose aggregate usage or de-identified information to a partner (or allow a partner to collect such information) in a manner that would identify you as an individual person.
         </p>
         <p>
         <b>Affiliated Businesses:</b> In certain situations, businesses or third party websites we're affiliated with may sell or provide products or services to you through or in connection with the Services (either alone or jointly with us). You can recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service, and we will share your Personal Information with that affiliated business only to the extent that it is related to such transaction or service. One such service may include the ability for you to automatically transmit Third Party Account Information to your Services profile or to automatically transmit information in your Services profile to your third party account. We have no control over the policies and practices of third party websites or businesses as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to take part in any transaction or service relating to an affiliated website or business, please review all such business' or websites' policies.
         </p>
         <p>
         <b>Agents:</b> We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you; for example, we use MyTime to handle the scheduling, record keeping,  and payment processing. Unless we tell you differently, our agents do not have any right to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. Note that an "agent" may also be considered a "partner" in certain circumstances, and would be subject to the terms of the <b>"Information that's been de-identified"</b> section in that regard.
         </p>
         <p>
         <b>Business Transfers:</b> We may choose to buy or sell assets, and may share and/or transfer customer information in connection with the evaluation of and entry into such transactions. Also, if we (or our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, Personal Information could be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party.
         </p>
         <p>
         <b>Protection of BarkDoc and Others:</b> We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information that we [reasonably] believe is necessary to comply with law or court order; enforce or apply our Terms and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of BarkDoc, our employees, our users, or others.
         </p>
         <p>
         Is Personal Information about me secure?
         </p>
         <p>
         Your account is protected by a password for your privacy and security. If you access your account via a third party site or service, you may have additional or different sign-on protections via that third party site or service. You must prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password and/or other sign-on mechanism appropriately and limiting access to your computer or device and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.
         </p>
         <p>
         We endeavor to protect the privacy of your account and other Personal Information we hold in our records, but unfortunately, we cannot guarantee complete security. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time.
         </p>
         <p>
         Your pet(s) records and personal information is stored in compliance with HIPAA.
         </p>
         <p>
         What Personal Information can I access?
         </p>
         <p>
         Through your account settings, you may access, and, in some cases, edit or delete the information you've provided to us
         </p>
         <p>
         The information you can view, update, and delete may change as the Services change. If you have any questions about viewing or updating information we have on file about you, please contact us at humans@barkdoc.com.
         </p>
         <p>
         What choices do I have?
         </p>
         <p>
         You can always opt not to disclose information to us, but keep in mind some information may be needed to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features.
         </p>
         <p>
         You may be able to add, update, or delete information as explained above. When you update information, however, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records. You may request deletion of your account by contacting BarkDoc at humans@barkdoc.com and asking us to delete your account. Some information may remain in our records after your deletion of such information from your account. We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally.
         </p>
         <p>
         What if I have questions about this policy?
         </p>
