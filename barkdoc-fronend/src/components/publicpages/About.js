                arkDoc founder Shana Urban was balancing a Fashion Buying career
                for 12 years with a busy schedule, her own rescue mutt Toodles,
                as well help fostering and getting over 20 dogs adopted for
                various rescue groups.
              </p>
              <p>
                She was always faced with the challenge of getting her dog and
                her fosters to their Veterinarian appointments. All public
                transportation (including cabs) requires a pet to be in an
                enclosed carrier or face refusal or worse-big fines. Her dog
                would not go in a carrier without being traumatized and some of
                her other fosters couldn’t fit in one, nor could she physically
                carry some of the carriers with the dogs she could fit. She
                found herself just leashing them up and begging cab drivers to
                take them or risking getting a ticket in the subway both ways.
                Upon arrival at the Vet’s office, her dog and fosters alike
                would become terrified along with all the others animals in the
                cramped waiting areas. Then within this tight space, the worry
                set in that her healthy pup or already weakened immune systemed
                foster pup would catch another dog’s illness while in the
                waiting area.
              </p>
              <p>
                She thought, there just has to be a better way, and the idea of
                BarkDoc was created.
              </p>
              <p>
                By partnering with Veterinarians, BarkDoc allows customers the
                convenience of booking an appointment online, staying right in
                your own home (or office even), and the Vet will come to you for
                what would be consistent with other Vet rates in your area.
              </p>
              <p>
                BarkDoc also offers lifetime discounts for all rescue group’s
                foster dogs, as well as all of our brave Veterans with service
                animals.
